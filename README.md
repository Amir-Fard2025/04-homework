## Description

Description: Define a code which enables users attending in quiz consisting of multiple choices in a certain amount of time. This Project uses java script and Web APIs together. The Interface of the project is relatively interactive with user and acts according the main timer interval.

## Process

- build a repository in github
- clone the repository in local computer
- draw the flowchart(layout of the project) to simplify the process. this flowchart contains inputs(prompt), input questions, input answers(list of multiple choices), three messages which are showing the remaining time score and right or wrong messages.
- define the first structure of the code as follow:
- define all the variables
- define an array of objects fo different questions and answers and right choice for each question
- define the functions two functions to display questions and their answers
- define one fnction to take the right answer from the array
- define one function to combine the question and answer functions and show them on the display
- define main function to feed the score and message variable
- define function to start and another one to finish the game
  -finally one eventlistener will responsible to run the whole code

## Objectives

-understanding the functions, how we use them in local and global sopes

- understanding the objects and their capabilities of saving data
- understanding the web APIs and their function i.e setting timers or keeping data in local storage
- how to combine different
